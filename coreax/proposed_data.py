Classes for reading unsupervised and supervised input data.

In order to calculate a coreset, :meth:`~coreax.reduction.Coreset.fit` requires an
instance of a subclass of :class:`Data`. It is necessary to use
:class:`Data` because :class:`~coreax.reduction.Coreset` requires a
two-dimensional :class:`~jax.Array`. Data reductions are performed along the first
dimension.
